We aim at revealing the function mechanisms of membrane proteins by using multi-scale computer simulations, in collaboration with experimental studies. Our main interests currently involve the permeation mechanism of ion channels, signaling through membrane-associated proteins, and interaction between antimicrobial peptides and lipid bilayers. We also use machine learning-based methods for the structural and functional studies of membrane proteins.

Our ultimate goal is to contribute to membrane protein- or membrane-targeted drug design and optimization, and thereby to improve peopleâ€™s health at large.
